# Credit-Card-Churn-Behavior

1. Case Context
A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers‘ decisions in the opposite direction. The dataset we have consists of 10,000 customers mentioning 18 features like their age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. We have only 16.07% of customers who have churned.

2. Scope of solution space 
a) Understand the correlations of customer features against churn/retention status
b) Predict whether the customer will get churned given their features
c) Provide better services to keep the customers

3. Constraints within solution space
a) We only have 16.07% of customers who have churned, so the data size may not be large enough for accurate prediction.
b) The validity of customer features affects the accuracy of prediction. For example, we do not know whether the salaries are real or whether the marital status and age are up to date.
